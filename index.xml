      <description>This is a bit of a Tuesday micro-blog looking at the performance of various solutions for concurrent map insertion/retrieval in golang.
In particular I&amp;rsquo;m going to look at three types of Map:
 Go&amp;rsquo;s builtin map type, protected by a read-write mutex (sync/atomic/RWMutex) Go&amp;rsquo;s new sync.Map type, which is an optimized scalable concurrent map. Go&amp;rsquo;s builtin map type, protected by an elided rw-mutex.  </description>

      <description>So, yesterday I ran the London Marathon for the 3rd time. My preparation was far from ideal this year, I got injured in the month before (strained hip muscle) and so unfortunately I never got enough mileage into my training regime. This meant that at about 13 miles the run became more about will power than physical power. My mind started to tell me to give up, and my aching body was sending strong signals to my brain that that would be the best thing to do.</description>
